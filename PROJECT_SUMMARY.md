## 🚀 How to Use (Student Perspective)

### Day Before Presentation

**Step 1**: Test Your Project
```bash
# DBMS Project
cd DBMS_Project
mysql -u root -p funding_system < database_schema.sql
python app.py
# Test in browser

# OS Project
cd OS_Project
python main.py --demo
```

**Step 2**: Read Your Script
- Open `Student_X_Script.md` (X = your number)
- Memorize the 2-3 minute presentation
- Read the 5 FAQ answers
- Understand the demo flow

**Step 3**: Practice Demo
- Run your module independently
- Practice what you'll show
- Prepare backup screenshots

**Step 4**: Understand Integration
- Skim other students' scripts
- Know how your module connects
- Be ready to explain data flow

### During Presentation

**Your Turn (2-3 minutes)**:
1. Introduce yourself and your module
2. Explain what you built (30 sec)
3. Show key code (30 sec)
4. Demo functionality (60 sec)
5. Explain integration (30 sec)

**Q&A Tips**:
- If asked about your code: Walk through it line by line
- If asked about others' code: "That's [Student Y]'s module, they can explain better"
- If stuck: Relate back to your core responsibility
